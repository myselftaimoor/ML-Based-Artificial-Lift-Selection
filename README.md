# Artificial Lift Optimization in Eagle Ford Shale Formation

This repository contains the implementation of a **predictive model** developed to optimize **artificial lift methods** in the **Eagle Ford Shale Formation**, with a focus on improving efficiency in unconventional oil wells. The model was trained to predict the most efficient lift method based on input parameters and well characteristics.

## ‚≠ê Overview

- **Goal**: Improve efficiency in unconventional oil wells by predicting the optimal artificial lift method using machine learning.
- **Accuracy**: Achieved **96% accuracy** with various machine learning models.
- **Best Model**: Random Forest provided the highest accuracy among models such as SVM, KNN, and Logistic Regression.

## üß† Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset includes various well attributes, operational conditions, and performance metrics.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Key features include well depth, pressure, flow rate, and other geological factors.
3. **Model Selection**: Multiple models were evaluated, including:
    - **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**
    - **Random Forest**
    - **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)**
    - **Logistic Regression**
4. **Model Training**: The models were trained and validated using cross-validation.
5. **Evaluation**: The Random Forest model outperformed the others, achieving the highest accuracy of **96%**.
